# Local Weather Viewer

Its a web app that shows live weather information and forecast of your current location. I've used JavaScript and jQuery along with HTML and CSS to create it. It uses Openweather API for fetching weather informations. It also uses Google Maps API for all the location related data. I've used [Skycons](https://darkskyapp.github.io/skycons/), an amazing animated weather iconset made by DatkSkies, to present the weather data.

Feel free to create an issue if you find any bug. You can also contribute if you want to. :)
